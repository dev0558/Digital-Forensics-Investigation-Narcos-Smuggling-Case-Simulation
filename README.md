## 🧠 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world cyber forensics investigation involving a transnational drug smuggling operation intercepted at the Australian border. As a digital forensics analyst, I was assigned to examine confiscated memory dumps and hard disk images from three suspects—John Fredricksen (mule), Steve Kowhai (NZ contact), and Jane Esteban (undercover AFP officer).

The case required identifying roles, digital behaviors, encrypted files, and communications, using standard forensic methodology and legally admissible practices.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Extract and analyze evidence from disk and memory images
- Identify hidden/encrypted communication methods
- Reconstruct suspect activity timelines
- Preserve chain of custody and validate evidence
- Produce a professional forensic report suitable for legal proceedings

---

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- **FTK Imager** – Imaging, validation, previewing evidence
- **Autopsy** – File recovery, deleted files, keyword search
- **Volatility** – Memory dump analysis: processes, clipboard, connections
- **Steghide** – Detect/extract hidden data in media files
- **OSForensics** – Registry, email, and file system analysis
- **HashCalc** – Hash integrity verification (MD5/SHA1)

## 🔬 Key Findings

- **Discord Communications**: Recovered suspect conversations planning smuggling operations
- **Steganography**: Found ZIP files hidden inside JPEG images with smuggling instructions
- **Cloud Traces**: Discovered evidence of file sharing through OneDrive
- **Browser & Registry Artifacts**: Tracked visits to drug forums and shipping logistics tools
- **Memory Analysis**: Recovered IPs, passwords, clipboard data, and dark web traces
- **Timelines**: Reconstructed using shellbags, LNK files, and event logs

## 📚 Reflection

This investigation was a challenging and rewarding exercise in applied cyber forensics. It demonstrated how digital evidence can be traced, preserved, and interpreted to support law enforcement. The project refined my ability to work with volatile data, uncover hidden evidence, and build defensible forensic narratives across multiple platforms.
